      <h1>Something about me and how I ended up where I am</h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>I came home to Guangzhou on the date of 3 Mar 2021, departing from Melbourne, Australia . It is a city where I'd been living, studying, working, making friends, experiencing and exploring for the past 6 years.</p>

      <p>Resigned from my job in Feb and realised again how much I've been loved and cared for.</p>

      <p>Anyways, my flight was on the 3 Mar 2021 and arrived approximately 20:00 Standard Beijing Time.</p>

      <p>Staff and medical team onsite were <em>SUPER</em> helpful and responsive. I just followed instructions and everything went smoothly. Ended up in this hotel I'm in right now (as of 15 March 2021 21:45).</p>

      <p>Admittedly not the best hotel you can get but I'm home safe and what else I can ask for.</p>

      <p>So, alone, in a small room, <strong><em>with TV not even working (what a bummer!),</em></strong> what can you do to kill time?</p>

      <p>A friend of mine recommended learning to code. She's always wanted to initiate something like a small project but I've been too lazy to. And now would be the best time for me to start!</p>

      <p>I'm completely new to website development and stuff like this so bear with me if this website is not up to standard.</p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h1>What is the website about?</h1>
          <p> With my most-recently required and limited web development skills and knowledge, I am using this website to record my 14 days of quarantine starting from <u>16 March 2021</u>. Lucky for both of us I've only got 2 days left and I'd be outta here! Yoo-hoo!!</p>

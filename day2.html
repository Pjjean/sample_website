    <h1>16 March 2021</h1>
      <span>This is Ajen.</span>
      <p>Weather is pretty humid and hot in Guangzhou today for an early spring day. Temperature is 20&ndash;28 degrees celcius - a warm sunny day.</p>
      <p>I woke up 7.35 to be exact. I wouldn't say that I've been resting well ever since I was in quarantine. With the first two days as an exception mostly thanks to mental and physical fatigue. After that, I often find myself wandering in thoughts before sleep at night and eventually render myself rather lucid.</p>

      <p>One good thing about being in quarantine could possibly be ROUNTINE. Since you get knocked on the door and meals delivered every day around the same time, you unavoidable get adjusted to this schedule. At least that's the case for me because I am very particular with the conditions of how and where I sleep - I carry around with me earplugs and sleep masks at all times. And that means three knocks on the door in the morning would be enough to make me wide awake. </p>

      <p>I've been using the Learn Enough to Be Dangerous tutorials to learn web dev and today I learned about making tables in HTML.</p>

      <p>Here's one about what I had today - not that you will be curious, but for the purpose of my practicing HTML tables/.</p>
